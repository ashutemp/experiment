Welcome to the datascience wiki!

This wiki will be our central source of information regarding _everything_ related to Data Science. Users are requested to contribute articles, tutorials, blogs, writeups regarding previous data hacks to this wiki.

Before we start, its good to know that the learning curve is quite exponential here, initially it may look daunting(based on feedback from students of our college), most of you may feel frustrated and will find it easy to give u, but once you bear it, then things will become cool. (Initial rate of change in exponential curve is ~0 then its very fast) :smiley: 

The conventions used in the wiki are following:
* **basic** : you can master it in 50-100 hours
* **intermediate** : it will take 200-250 hours
* **advanced** : you are on your own! :laughing: (learn them and share your experience with us)
